### Description : This Python GUI application performs currency and unit conversions using Tkinter. Users can select either the currency or unit converter from the main menu. The currency converter reads exchange rates from a CSV file and supports conversions between various international currencies. The unit converter allows switching between units like meters, kilometers, miles, and feet. Dropdown menus and input fields make it easy to enter amounts and choose conversion options. The application ensures only numeric values are accepted through input validation. Conversion results are clearly displayed on the screen. A "Back" button enables returning to the main menu. Error messages handle issues such as missing files or incorrect data input. This tool provides a convenient, offline solution for quick conversions.
